### Kluster

"a package to deploy and configure highly-scalable production-grade apps using kubernetes on a bare-metal platform."

This project is refactoring a previous project `DevEnv`, introducing Terraform and Packer to install the kubernetes cluster.  This project is still very much in progress.  We archived the original `DevEnv` project on Github as a reference.  In a first stage, the goal is for `Kluster` to replicate `Devenv`.
