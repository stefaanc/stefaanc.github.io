I was asked why this place is called "The Dungeons"

Companies often don't really want software engineers to meet with customers:

1. software engineers often dress nerdy, talk nerdy, are nerdy
2. software engineers may talk about the wonderful bugs and ridiculous features they are working on
3. software engineers may even tell the customer what they really think about the company's products  
   

So,

if the customer goes to the right to the meeting rooms, put the software engineers in offices to the left.  
if the customer goes up to meet the sales team, put the software engineers down... in **the dungeons**.
but don't throw the key away, because that would be illegal.
