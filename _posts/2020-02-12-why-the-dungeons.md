I was asked why this place is called "The Dungeons"

Companies often don't really want software engineers to meet with customers:

1. software engineers often dress nerdy, talk nerdy, are nerdy
2. software engineers may talk about the wonderful bugs and ridiculous features they are working on
3. software engineers may tell the customer what they really think about the company's products  

So,

if the customer has to go to the right to the meeting rooms, put the software engineers in offices to the left.  
if the customer has to go up to meet the sales team, put the software engineers down... in the dungeons.
